In the beginning, I try to build application on android studio but was so hard because I never used this tool before. I watched some udemy tutorial video for some basic knowledge. Than afterwards, I watch some videos on YouTube and relate udemy tutorial to do my first step for Dublin bike API fetching. My JSON data is not coming in array form, then I downloaded JSON viewer extension for chrome to view it. Later on, I try to fetch the data by using different code somehow, I managed to fetched it. I try to show that fetched data on my android phone. 

But my phone was not connecting, then I saw one tutorial how to add android phone to android studio. I changed my ordinary phone into developer phone by clicking 7 time on build number. So, I connected my phone to android studio. Now, my next step was to parse the JSON data into list view. For this I saw different tutorial and try code from them to display list view using two more java classes namely: Contacts.java, ContactAdapter.java. In map activity, I have to create marker with loop and I was trying for loop but is only showing the error in it. The reason for this error was that I have to split position into two different items of the list view. 

After splitting the position into latitude and longitude than only generated array can be linked and we can use in map activity. I cracked this thing after 1 whole day by myself by searching and reading another people code in stack overflow. I updated my code and it work after all my work and all marker were on google map activity. On click name come as title on the marker.

In the end, I created git hub account. I saw tutorial how to upload project from android studio. As I am window user, I get one error that is get.exe is missing. I downloaded one git.exe file from google and try to test my git and it works. Then I saved my 1st commit and I pushed to GitHub from vcs in android studio.
